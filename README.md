### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Currently in my 4th year of College, looking for opportunities in the field as I am about to graduate. 
I am constantly seeking improvement and I mainly use Django and Javascript and I aim to become more proficient in the latter. 
My goal is to become a Backend Web Developer who can occassionally do Frontend stuff if needed. 
Looking forward to learning NodeJs in the meantime.
